All programs eventually leads to trees

Where are trees?:
- Your file system is a tree
- The dom is a tree
- Trees are massively important in compilers. You have probably mininumly heard the term Abstract Syntax Tree
- And many more...

Let's do a whiteboard example

# Common Tree Terminology
# Depth First Search
Recursion we keep passing the function to itself unitl we reach the base case.
In ***depth-first search***, we start at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explore as far down as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- The take away is that we go as deep as possible before we backtrack
