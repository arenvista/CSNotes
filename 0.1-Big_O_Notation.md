1. Big O Time Complexity

## Big O Time Complexity
Let's consider the following code snippet:
```rust
function sum_char_codes(n: string): number {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
        sum += n.charCodeAt(i);
    }
return sum;
}
How would you expect the program's execution time to grow with respect to input size
- The goal of this program is to add the character codes of each character in the input string `n` and return the sum.
     - This means that as the string `n` grows in size, the number of iterations in the loop will also grow, linearly.

This means that this function is simply O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the size of the input string.

`Hot Tip - When trying to determine time complexity, look for loops and nested loops.`

```rust
function sum_char_codes(n: string): number {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
        sum += n.charCodeAt(i);
    }
return sum;
}
```

If the prior was O(n), what would you expect the time complexity of the following code snippet to be?
```rust
function sum_char_codes(n: string): number {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
        sum += n.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
        sum += n.charCodeAt(i);
    }
}
```
I would guess O(n) because the real result is O(2n) but O(n) notation ignores constants.


There's a distinction between "are these constants meaningful or relevant?" and "does big-O notation care about them?" The answer to that second question is "no," while the answer to that first question is "absolutely!"

[[Big-O Notation Dosent Care About restraints]]

```rust
function sum_char_codes(n: string ): number {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; ++i) {
    const char Code = n.charCodeAt(i);
    // Capital E
    if (charCode == 69) {
```

** Recall Concepts **
1.  growth is in respect to input size 
2. constants are ignored in Big O notation
3. worst case is ***usually*** the way we measure
