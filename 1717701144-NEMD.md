# HTTP
In standard HTTP all information is sent in clear text

# HTTPS

HTTPS encypts the data before sending it over the network - this is done using SSL/TLS

# SSL
SSL or Secure Sockets Layer is a protocol that secures the channel.

When a computer connects to a website using SSL. 
The webbrowser will ask the website to identify itself -> the website will send a copy of its SSL certificate to the browser.
This SSL certificate is used prove the identity of the website.
If OK then the browser will send a message to the website saying it is ready to start encrypted communication.

# TLS
TLS or Transport Layer Security is the successor to SSL.
This also authenticates the server and client and encrypts the data.
