# Compilers Function
A compiler take your program and turn it into machine code, which we call an executable, which can be run on its own without the compiler.
- This executable can then be run seperatly on any data to get an output.

Essentially a compiler is like a preprocessing step that produces an executable that can be run on its own, while a interperter is like a program that runs your program on the data you give it.
