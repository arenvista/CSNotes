# Arrays
Are contiguous blocks of memory consisting of elements of the same type.
- They are allocated in a single block of memory and all at once.
- They are indexed and allow for direct access to elements in the array at a constant time.

So stating a = int[3] i; is an array of 3 integers.
- Really what we're saying here is to the offset of a and multiply by the size of the type and the number of elements

[0][0][0][0]
