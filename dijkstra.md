# Dijkstra's Algorithm

What is Dijkstra's Shortest Path?
- What is it?
    It is calculating the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph.
- Where is it used?
    It is used in GPS systems to find the shortest path between two locations.

It is a "greedy" algorithim - it always chooses the next node with the smallest distance from the source node.
