# Tree Traversal

Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure. There are three main ways to traverse a tree.
The important thing to remember is the order in which we visit the nodes. The three main ways to traverse a tree are:
- In-order
    - Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree
        - recurse_left()
        - visitNode()
        - recurse_right()
- Pre-order
    - Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree
        - visitNode()
        - recurse_left()
        - recurse_right()
- Post-order
    - Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root
        - recurse_left()
        - recurse_right()
        - visitNode()

**A traversal will have us visit a node, and then recurse**
