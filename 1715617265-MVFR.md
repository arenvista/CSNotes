# Interperters Function

A interperter takes as input your program and the data you want to run it on and it produces the output of your program with that data. 
- Meaning that it does not compile your program into machine code, it just runs it.
     - This is "on-line" meaning the work it does is all towarnds the goal of running your program.
This is counter to the [[Compilers Function]]
