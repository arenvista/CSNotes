# convert binary to decimal

For example consider a single byte 

[1][0][1][0][0][0][0][0]

This byte is currently represented in binary as 10100000.

This is base 2 notation, so the value of this byte is 160 in base 10. 

(10100000)base(2) = (160)(base)10
Step by step solution

Step 1: Write down the binary number:

10100000

Step 2: Multiply each digit of the binary number by the corresponding power of two:

1x2^7 + 0x2^6 + 1x2^5 + 0x2^4 + 0x2^3 + 0x2^2 + 0x2^1 + 0x2^0

Step 3: Solve the powers:

1x128 + 0x64 + 1x32 + 0x16 + 0x8 + 0x4 + 0x2 + 0x1 = 128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0

Step 4: Add up the numbers written above:

128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 160.

So, 160 is the decimal equivalent of the binary number 10100000.
