# Semantic Analysis

Once sentence struture is understood, we can try to understand "meaning"
- This is hard

Compilers do this to a limited extent and is what we mean by semantic analysis

For example:
"Jack said jerry left his assignment at home." -> what does *his* refer to?

Even worse:
"Jack said Jack left his assignment at home?" -> How many people?

***Programing languages define strict rules to avoid such ambiguities***
```cpp
{
    int Jack = 3;
    {
        int Jack = 4;
        cout << Jack; 
    }
}
```
In here Jack when is printed will be 4 since we use scope to avoid this ambiguity in this case 

Here's another example:
"Jack left her homework at home"

We can see that "Jack" and "her" are incompatible ~ this is analogous to type checking
