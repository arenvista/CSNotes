Let's say we have the following people:
a, b, c, d, e,

and we have 5 chairs:
_ _ _ _ _

How many ways can we arrange the people in the chairs?

 5 _ _ _ _  -> 5 ways to choose the first person

5*4 _ _ _  -> 4 ways to choose the second person

5*4*3 _ _  -> 3 ways to choose the third person...

5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5! = 120 different ways to arrange the people in the chairs.

What if we had just 3 chairs?

5 * 4 * 3 = 60 different ways to arrange the people in the chairs.
