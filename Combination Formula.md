Let's say we have 6 people again:

a, b, c, d, e, f

and we have 4 chairs we wanted to place them in

6*5*4*3 
_ _ _ _ = 6!/2! = 6*5*4*3*2*1/2*1

***Recall the permutation formula: nPr = n!/(n-r)!***

But what about combinations?

Well we just have to divde the total number of permutations by the number of ways the groups can be arranged - this gives us only the ***unique groupings (combinations)***.

Recall: the # of ways to arrage a group of r people in r spots is r!

So we can say combinations = permutations / r! = nPr/r! = n!/(n-r)!r!
