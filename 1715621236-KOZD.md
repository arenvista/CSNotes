# Optimization

In regards to optimization there is no strong analogy in English.

The closest being something like:
- "But *a litte bit like* editing" -> "But *akin to* editing"

The goal is to automagically modify our programs so that they run faster and use less memory

We can define a rule in our compiler where X = Y * 0 is the same as X = 0
- Note this is not a valid rule for all cases; it is only true for ints and not floats
    - There is a special number (nan) where (nan * 0) = nan and NOT 0
