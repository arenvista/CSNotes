# Parsing

The next step once the words have been identifed is to understand the struture of the sentence - parsing.

This means *diagram the sentence* to understand the structure of the sentence.

```
This    line    is      a    longer  sentence
 |       |       |      |       |        |
article  noun   verb  article  adj     noun
  |_______|       |      |______|_______|
      |           |             |
    subject     verb           object
      |___________|______________|
                  |
                sentence
```
Just like how we can parse this sentence into it's "tokens/words" we must do the same for our programs

```
if x == y then z = 1; else z = 2;

x  ==   y             z   1               z   2
|___|___|             |___|               |___|
    |                   |                   |
 relation             assign              assign
    |                   |                   |
predicate           then-stmt           else-stmt   
   |____________________|___________________|
                        |
                   if-then-else
```
