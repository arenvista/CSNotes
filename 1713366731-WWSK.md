# 1713366727-CIQQ|Removing a Node From a Linked List

Consider a Linked List with the following nodes:

```
[a]⇌[b]⇌[c]⇌[d]
```

To remove a node from a linked list, we need to update the pointers of the nodes surrounding the node we want to remove.
Let's say we want to remove node `c` from the list.

1. Set the `next` pointer of node `b` to the `next` pointer of node `c`.
```
[a]⇌[b]<-[c]⇌[d]
      |_______^
```
2. Set the `prev` pointer of `d` to `b`
```
     ↓---------↖
[a]⇌[b]<-[c]->[d]
      |________^
```
2. Unset the pointers of C
```
[a]⇌[b]⇌[c]⇌[d]

null<-[c]->null
```
***Recall the order of the operations***

Also note no matter the size of the list to insernt an elemnts will always take as long as it takes is to adjust the pointers to the correct fields which is a **constant** time operation
