# Time Complexity of Linked Lists

## Insertions & Deletions
Consider the nature of [[1713366142-IMCX|Inserting a Node Into a Linked List]]
The case is similar for [[1713366731-WWSK|Removing a Node From a Linked List]].
The benifit of linked lists is that it can be fairly quick to insert or delete elements from the list. This is because we only need to change a few pointers to do so. The number of pointers do not scale with input size and are **constant**

Though deletions in the middle can be costly if the ***traversal*** is costly.

If our linked list has a refrence to the start or end of the list these gets can be costant time.
