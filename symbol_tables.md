Most of the timek[[MergeSort#mergesort]]kand [[Binary Search#binary-search]] is often times not enough when dealing with lists that are frequently updated.
- It is cumbersome to sort the list whenever a new element is added.
- We may also want to associate all sorts of info with each element in the list.

With ***Symbol Tables***, we can associate a value with a key and then later search for the value using the key.
- This gives us much more flexibility than just sorting the list and searching for the value.
- These are essentally hash tables or dictionaries in other languages.

The idea is called an associative array abstraction
- Imagine using arrays whose inicies are string values
