# Inserting a Node Into a Linked List
Let's say we have a linked list like this:
![ll1.png](assets/imgs/ll1.png)

And let's say we wanted to insert a new node (f) between nodes (a) and (b)

We can do the following:

1. Create a new node (f)

2. Set (a) -> (f)
![ll2.png](assets/imgs/ll2.png)

3. Set (f) -> (a)
![ll3.png](assets/imgs/ll3.png)

4. Set (f) -> (b) && (b) -> (f)
![ll4.png](assets/imgs/ll4.png)

And that's it! We've inserted a new node into a linked list.

***Notice how to insert an element into a linked list we only need to change 3 pointers.***

***changing pointers is constant time O(1)***
- heckin fast

`But note that the opperational order is extremely important. It is necessary for us to keep track of the pointers so we don't lose any nodes when reassigning them.`
