# The Last Algorithm Course You'll Ever Need 0.2-Arrays Data Structure

If...

```
const i = []
```
Isn't an array, what is it?

-- Sorry it's not - the goal of this section is to understand what this is.

[[Arrays]]- is a contiguous block of memory consisting of elements of the same type.

So stating a = int[3] i; is an array of 3 integers.
- Really what we're saying here is to the offset of a and multiply by the size of the type and the number of elements

See [[convert binary to decimal]]
