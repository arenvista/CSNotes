# Lexical Analysis

The goal of lexical analysis is to divide program text into "words" or "tokens"

if x == y then z == 1 ; else z = 2;

We have operators, variables, Seperators, and values.

```
Operators: ==, =, ; <---*
Seperators: (, )        | --- These are all processed by the lexical analyzer into **tokens**
Variables: x, y, z      |
Values: 1, 2  <---------*
```
